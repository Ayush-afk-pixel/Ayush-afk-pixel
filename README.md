<h1 align="center">A New Chapter for Hackathons</h1>
<h3 align="center"><em>Purposefully designed. Carefully engineered. Built to scale.</em></h3>

<p align="center">
I love building eye-catching digital products — the kind that blend great engineering with thoughtful design.  
Right now, I'm focused on something the hackathon space has needed for a long time.

## 🌍 **What I Am Working On (At a High Level)**

The hackathon ecosystem is massive — yet still scattered, inefficient, and full of friction.  
Most participants feel it… but no one has truly solved it.

So I’m building a platform that aims to:

- reduce friction  
- simplify workflows  
- empower young developers  
- and unify the experience in a way existing tools don't  

The prototype is functional.  
The vision is ambitious.  
The opportunity is real.

To take it to the next level, I’m looking for a strong technical partner who can help refine, scale, and ship a production-ready product.

## 🧠 **The Vision (lightly revealed, strongly compelling)**

I believe hackathons should be more than temporary events.  
They should be pipelines where talent is discovered, teams are formed, and careers accelerate.

My long-term vision is to create a system that quietly removes the “fragmentation tax” affecting millions of students — and becomes the default space where early-career developers build their journey.

Think of it as building the **“home layer” beneath the global hackathon community**.  
Not another event platform — but the missing infrastructure.

If this resonates, you’ll understand why I’m so committed to bringing this to life.

## 🔥 **Why I'm Sharing This**

I’m seeking:

- a developer who wants to build something meaningful  
- mentors who understand product, architecture, or community  
- early supporters interested in a high-potential space  

---

## 🛠️ **Tech I Work With**

- **Frontend:** Next.js, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion  
- **Backend:** Supabase (Realtime, Auth, Storage, DB)  
- **Realtime:** Socket.IO  
- **Design:** Figma + custom visuals  

I prioritize clean architecture, great UX, and visually engaging interfaces.

## 🤝 **Let’s Connect**

If you're exploring developer tools, hackathon infrastructure, or future-of-education tech — I'd love to talk.
