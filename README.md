<h1 align="center">Designed in Prompts</h1>
<h3 align="center"><eAll-in-One Competitive Gaming Hub — Structured Like Code, Powered by Language</em></h3>

<p align="center">
Built by a <strong>Prompt Engineer</strong> who codes less and thinks more. Every feature, database model, and flow is born from thought → prompt → system. Welcome to a new way of building.

<h2>🚀 What I Build & How I Work</h2>

<img align="right" src="https://www.codedex.io/images/character_gifs/Ai30sjf.gif" width="480" alt="Coffee Pixel Animation" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 10px;" />

<p>
I'm a <strong>solo builder</strong>, <strong>prompt engineer</strong>, and <strong>full-stack creator</strong> with a mindset of precision and a roadmap of ambition.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>🧠 I engineer with <strong>prompts first</strong> — systems, flows, UI, logic — all born in language, then brought to life.</li>
  <li>📅 I work with a <strong>task-per-day mindset</strong> — small, focused wins that compound into something great.</li>
  <li>⚙️ I obsess over <strong>efficiency</strong>, clean UX, and <strong>performance-first thinking</strong>.</li>
  <li>🧰 I don't just build features — <strong>I build flows</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
🤫 <strong>My team?</strong> Me.<br />
<small>My designer? Me.<br />
My tester? Still me.<br />
Coffee? Always there.</small>
</p>

<h6>
I build solo, but not aimlessly. Every bit of code exists for a reason. Every step moves the system forward.

<p>
Currently shaping an <strong>esports operating system</strong> — from scratch.<br />
No templates. No guesswork.<br />
Everything <strong>prompt-crafted</strong>, optimized, and tailored for competitive flow.
</p>

<p>
Real-time chat, tournament automation, community spaces, wallet systems, social feeds, and notification logic — all in one seamless UI.
</p>

<h6>Built in public. Shipped in silence. Polished with intention.</h6>

<h2>🧠 Prompt-Driven Engineering</h2>

<p>
This project is more than code — it's a product of <strong>language shaping logic</strong>. Built through hundreds of refined prompts, it uses AI as a co-pilot for architecture, UI flows, and real-time interaction logic. Prompt engineering here isn't just about talking to AI — it's about <strong>engineering scalable systems through structured thought</strong>.

<h6>
Esports platforms are scattered. What players need is one immersive home. <br/>
From team formation to tournament victory, <strong>this is where competitive gaming happens.</strong>
</h6>

**Focused On:**
- Fair, automated tournaments
- Real-time communication infrastructure
- Role-managed communities
- A dark, intuitive gamer-first interface
