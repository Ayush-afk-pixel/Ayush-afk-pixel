<h2>🧠 Prompt-Driven Engineering</h2>

<p>
This project is more than code — it's a product of <strong>language shaping logic</strong>. Built through hundreds of refined prompts, it uses AI as a co-pilot for architecture, UI flows, and real-time interaction logic. Prompt engineering here isn't just about talking to AI — it's about <strong>engineering scalable systems through structured thought</strong>.
